1. Plotting cumulative distance to closest enhancer 

* while building flexible functions so that can add other, similar analyses:
 "cumulative distance plots to nearest ChIP peak"

For 1-day dNipBL dataset:
- add coordinates of TSS to each gene (flt.get_tss_gene_intervals())
- split by up/down/non-reg genes (flt.label_DE_status())
- Collect cumulative distances:
    - (pseudocode)
    for each set of enhancers (feature_interval):
        distances  = bioframe.closest(gene_coords, middle_of_enhancer_coords)
    - with above datastructure, plots:
    sort distances
    # line plot
    plot(cumulative_fraction(genes), sorted_distances)
    # histogram, too
    plt.hist(sorted_distances, binned)


2. How many dysregulated genes contain a distal enhancer in the same TAD?
â†’ bar plots, broken up by up/down/non, either as counts or %

Using the 1-day dNipBL dataset and mappings of closest enhancers:
- Use bonev boundaries to annotate "TAD-windows"
- Within each "TAD-window", count:
    - number of enhancers within the window (bioframe.overlap)
    - number of up-regulated, down-regulated, non-significant genes
    - percentage of up/down/non-sig genes
- plot: bar-graphs with number of enhancers/window on X-axis, category
of gene distribution on y-axis
